# Web-Scraper
This code scrapes Indeed's website for Front end developer related jobs in Lagos, Nigeria. 
The code will download the job posting page's HTML content using Python requests library and parse this information with Beautiful Soup to extract the desired information.
To change the search parameters, replace the job title and location in the URL object. This script will only parse through the first page of an Indeed job search.
